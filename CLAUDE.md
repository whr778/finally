# FinAlly Project - the Finance Ally

All project documentation is in the `planning` directory.

The key document is PLAN.md included in full below; the market data component has been completed and is summarized in the file `planning/MARKET_DATA_SUMMARY.md` with more details in the `planning/archive` folder. Consult these docs only when required. The remainder of the platform is still to be developed.

## Dolt Server — Operational Awareness (All Agents)

Dolt is the data plane for beads (issues, mail, identity, work history). It runs
as a single server on port 3307 serving all databases. **It is fragile.**

### If you detect Dolt trouble

Symptoms: `bd` commands hang/timeout, "connection refused", "database not found",
query latency > 5s, unexpected empty results.

**BEFORE restarting Dolt, collect diagnostics.** Dolt hangs are hard to
reproduce. A blind restart destroys the evidence. Always:

```bash
# 1. Capture goroutine dump (safe — does not kill the process)
kill -QUIT $(cat ~/gt/.dolt-data/dolt.pid)  # Dumps stacks to Dolt's stderr log

# 2. Capture server status while it's still (mis)behaving
gt dolt status 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dolt-hang-$(date +%s).log

# 3. THEN escalate with the evidence
gt escalate -s HIGH "Dolt: <describe symptom>"
```

**Do NOT just `gt dolt stop && gt dolt start` without steps 1-2.**

**Escalation path** (any agent can do this):
```bash
gt escalate -s HIGH "Dolt: <describe symptom>"     # Most failures
gt escalate -s CRITICAL "Dolt: server unreachable"  # Total outage
```

The Mayor receives all escalations. Critical ones also notify the Overseer.

### If you see test pollution

Orphan databases (testdb_*, beads_t*, beads_pt*, doctest_*) accumulate on the
production server and degrade performance. This is a recurring problem.

```bash
gt dolt status              # Check server health + orphan count
gt dolt cleanup             # Remove orphan databases (safe — protects production DBs)
```

**NEVER use `rm -rf` on `~/.dolt-data/` directories.** NEVER remove, delete, or modify files inside Dolt's `.dolt/` directory — including `noms/LOCK` files. These are Dolt-internal files. Removing them WILL cause unrecoverable data corruption and data loss. Dolt manages these files itself; external interference is never safe.

### Key commands
```bash
gt dolt status              # Server health, latency, orphan count
gt dolt start / stop        # Manage server lifecycle
gt dolt cleanup             # Remove orphan test databases
```

### Communication hygiene

Every `gt mail send` creates a permanent bead + Dolt commit. Every `gt nudge`
creates nothing. **Default to nudge for routine agent-to-agent communication.**

Only use mail when the message MUST survive the recipient's session death
(handoffs, structured protocol messages, escalations). See `mail-protocol.md`.
